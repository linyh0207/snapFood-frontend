# SnapFood

This is a full stack mobile application specically for Android that makes reporting discounted grocery items faster and searching for real time food deals easier! A group project of Lighthouse Labs' Career Readiness Bootcamp, we use React Native with Expo for front-end, Node.js and TypeScript for back-end, MongoDB as database. Also, we bring in Google Places API for location feature. My responsibility is making the front-end components according to our wireframes and connecting the front-end routes using React Navigation.
